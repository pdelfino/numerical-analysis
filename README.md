Introduction to Numerical Analysis
---

 + I did this for the course "Análise Numérica" (Numerical Analysis) at the Escola de Mamemática Aplicada (EMAp). 
 
 + Professor: PhD Moacyr Alvim

 + Date: 2018.2.

 + Tech Stack: Python 3.

 + Programming exercises involving: 
   - Jacobi's method;
   - Newtown's method;
   - Bissection's method;
   - Polynomial Interpolation;
   - Cubic Spline;
   - Euler's numerical method for differential equations;
   - Heun's method;
   - RungeKutta's method;
   - Richardson extrapolation;
   - Simpson's rules;
   - Romberg's method;
   - Gaussian quadrature;
   - MonteCarlo integration; and
   - others.
   
 + Support Material: Numerical Mathematics and Computing. CHENEY, Ward and KINCAID, David.

# Disclaimer:

I am pretty sure there is a lot of space for more organization, bug-fixes, generalizations and refactoring of the programs. I hope I will have some time one day to brush up this repo. 

Use my code as you wish. If you find the bugs, please let me know. I would appreciate any pull requests!
